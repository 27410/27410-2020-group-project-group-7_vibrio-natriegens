    "The fast-growing marine Vibrio natriegens is an emerging synthetic biology chassis and a promising candidate for an industrial cell factory. The bacterium possesses many desirable qualities for a cell factory making it interesting for industrial application. This includes a high growth and substrate uptake rate, metabolic diversity, genetic tractability, and tolerance against high salinity (Hoff et al. 2020). *V. natriegens* belongs to the Gram-negative class of Gamma-proteobacteria and provides a promising alternative to the commonly used industrial workhorse, *E. coli*. \n",
    "\n",
    "*V. natriegens* is ubiquitous in the marine natural environment and thus thrive in high salinity. In industrial fermentation, the cost of water is a significant expense. However, seawater can be used in the fermentation process for *V. natriegens* and thus significantly reduce the expense of water. Furthermore, the marine bacterium has a high metabolic diversity and can utilize a wide range of substrates including cheap substrates such as sucrose and glycerol (Hoffart et al. 2017; Ellis et al. 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently several established molecular biology techniques for *V. natriegens* including electroporation, conjugation, and CRIPSPR-Cas9 (Hoff et al. 2020). Recent studies have revealed that many methods and tools for production in *E. coli* can be applied in *V. natriegens* (Tschirhart et al. 2019; Eichmann et al. 2019). The codon usage in the two organisms are fairly similar (Hoff et al. 2020). A recent study investigated how well genetic components commonly used for *E. coli* work in *V. natriegens* (Tschirhart et al. 2019). This revealed that many of the synthetic biology tools can also be applied in the fast-growing vibrio. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been suggested that *E. coli* tools and protocols could be a good starting point for developing more tools for *V. natriegens* (Hoff et al. 2020). This signifies that tools and methods for *V. natriegens* can hopefully be expeditiously developed for the optimization of *V. natriegens* as a cell factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high growth rate of *V. natriegens* makes it highly interesting as a commercial cell factory. *V. natriegens* is reported to have the highest growth rate hitherto observed in a non-pathogenetic organism and has a generation time of less than 10 minutes (Hoffart et al. 2017). In comparison, the growth rate for *E. coli* is usually 15-20 minutes. This trait could prove very timesaving and speed up the Design, Build, Test, and Learn (DBTL) cycle for the cell factory development (Eichmann et al. 2019). \n"

    "The natural product beta carotene is terpenoid that are naturally produced in fungi, plant and fruits. It is a colored red-orange pigment by which is it often used for food coloring in the food and beverage industry. It is also used for natural cosmetic products and besides being a pigment, it is also the most common source for provitamin A. The production of vitamin A is of interesting because vitamin A has multiple functions in the body, such as vision and the immune system. To express beta carotene in Vibrio natriegens, the beta carotene pathway from Vibrio campbellii and the mevalonate (MVA) biosynthetic pathway from the Gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus were introduced to get the right precursors. \n",
    "Vibrio natriegens already produce the important precursors Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) through its upstream methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, but this product seems to be a bottleneck in the production of beta carotene. To solve this issue, the MVA pathway from Lactobacillus acidophilus is introduced and thereby more IPP is produced. IPP is then used in the beta carotene pathway from Vibrio campbellii to reach the final product. Beta carotene have already been experimentally heterologously expressed in V. natriegens and other microbial chassis with great success. By making a computed V. natriegens cell factory the goal is to increase the production rate of beta carotene by model optimizing. (Kilde: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950413/)\n",
    "The pathways can be seen in figure… \n",
    "\n",
    "The market value of beta carotene has increased with the raised awareness of its properties and its health benefits. During the past years there have been an increased demand from the consumers for natural and organic products, which is why many companies have started using beta carotene as ingredients in their products. The global market size of beta carotene was 314.14 billion US dollars in 2020 and the market size is estimated to grow to 380.37 billion US dollars before 2025. In Europe the most preferred dye in food processing is beta carotene and are also sneaking in to the American market as the most preferred dye. Further the Asian market are big contributors to the global beta carotene market, due to the increased use of cosmetics. At the moment the beta carotene industry is dominated by the two companies DSM N.V. and BASF SE. but they are followed by the Danish company Chr. Hansen. The increasing market value as a result of the raising demand seems to keep growing during the next many years. This makes the production of beta carotene interesting and finding a new better production organism can therefore be essential for future beta carotene production.

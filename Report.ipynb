    "The fast-growing marine *Vibrio natriegens* is an emerging synthetic biology chassis and a promising candidate for an industrial cell factory. The bacterium possesses many desirable qualities for a cell factory making it interesting for industrial application. This includes a high growth and substrate uptake rate, metabolic diversity, genetic tractability, and tolerance against high salinity. *V. natriegens* belongs to the Gram-negative class of Gamma-proteobacteria and provides a promising alternative to the commonly used industrial workhorse, *E. coli*. \n",
    "\n",
    "*V. natriegens* is ubiquitous in the marine natural environment and thus thrive in high salinity. In industrial fermentation, the cost of water is a significant expense. However, seawater can be used in the fermentation process for *V. natriegens* and thus significantly reducing the expense for water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent studies have revealed that many methods and tools for production in *E. coli* can be applied with *V. natriegens* (Tschirhart et al. 2019; Eichmann et al. 2019). A recent study investigated how well genetic components commonly used for *E. coli* work in V. natriegens (Tschirhart et al. 2019). This revealed that many of the synthetic biology tools can also be applied in the fast-growing vibrio. It has thus also been suggested that *E. coli* tools and protocols could be a good starting point for developing more tools for *V. natriegens* (Hoff et al. 2020). This could signify that tools and methods for *V. natriegens* can expeditiously be optimized as a cell factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high growth rate of *V. natriegens* makes it highly interesting as a commercial cell factory. *V. natriegens* is reported to have the highest growth rate hitherto observed in a non-pathogenetic organism and has a generation time of less than 10 minutes (Hoffart et al. 2017). In comparison, the growth rate for *E. coli* is usually 15-20 minutes. This trait could prove very timesaving and speed up the Design, Build, Test, and Learn (DBTL) cycle for the cell factory development (Eichmann et al. 2019). \n"

    "This project will produce the high demanded product beta carotene in a more efficient and environmentally friendly way. Beta carotene have been used as a dye for both human and animal feed for many years. Todayâ€™s production of beta carotene is 95% chemical and 5% natural. This chemical produced beta carotene can be damaging to the environment and moreover the increased focus on human health and natural produced products demands for a more sustainable and natural production. It would therefore have an effect on the climate change mitigation to change a larger part of the chemical produced beta-carotene to bioproduced beta-carotene.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, the heterologous pathway for beta-carotene can be introduced into the marine bacterium *V. natriegens*. This bacterium has shown to be fast-growing and therefore an efficient organism for a cell factory. One of the reasons it is interesting to introduce the beta-carotene pathway into *V. natriegens* instead of using for example *Yarrowia lipolytica* is that *V. natriegens* has shown good results being cultivated in sea water. This will reduce the use of drinking water significantly and as clean drinking water is a limiting resource it can help the UN with sustainable development goal 6. "

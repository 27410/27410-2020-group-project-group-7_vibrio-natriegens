    "The market for beta-carotene will increase the coming years and therefore a more efficient way of producing the compound can be necessary. By introducing the heterologous pathway for beta-carotene production into the bacterium *V. natriegens* one would have an efficient and fast-growing organism as a cell factory for beta-carotene production.\n",

    "Today beta-carotene is mainly produced chemically which can be damaging to the environment. It would therefore have an effect on the climate change mitigation to change a larger part of the chemical produced beta-carotene to bioproduced beta-carotene. One of the reasons it is interesting to introduce the beta-carotene pathway into *V. natriegens* instead of using for example *Yarrowia lipolytica* is that *V. natriegens* has shown good results being cultivated in sea water. This will reduce the use of drinking water significantly and as clean drinking water is a limiting resource it can help the UN with sustainable development goal 6."

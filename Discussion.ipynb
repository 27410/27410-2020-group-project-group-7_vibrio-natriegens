    "Beta-carotene has previously been succesfully expressed in *V. natriegens* and thus verifies that the heterologous expression is possible (Ellis et al. 2019). In that study, the titer of beta-carotene was approximately 0.5 mg/L without adding the MVA pathway. The beta-carotene production in *V. natriegens* was increased approximately 6-fold in LBv2 rich medium when the MVA pathway from from *Lactobacillus acidophilus* NCFM was additionally introduced (Ellis et al. 2019). When the MVA-pathway was introduced into *V. natriegens*, the titer was almost 3 mg/L (Ellis et al. 2019). The titer was not calculated in this report as no volume was mentioned. To compare the results obtained in Ellis *et al.* with this report the production rate of beta-carotene was calculated with and without the MVA pathway introduced. No difference between the two scenarios was seen in respect to production rate of beta-carotene. The reason for this could be the GSM model not taken concentrations.\n",

    "The maximal theoretical production of betacaroten was more than 2-fold higher in *V. natriegens* compared to the *E. coli* iML1515 model. \n",

    "The heterologous expression of beta-carotene in *V. natriegens* in this study was meant as a proof-of-concept to investigate if production in this host was possible. The aim was thus not to improve the yield of beta-carotene. For this reason, it might be possible to experimentally achieve a higher yield."
